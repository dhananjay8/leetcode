If input array is sorted then
 - Binary search
 - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then 
 - Backtracking

If given a tree then 
 - DFS
 - BFS

If given a graph then
 - DFS
 - BFS

If given a linked list then 
 - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
 - Stack

If must solve in-place then
 - Swap corresponding values
 - Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/ subset/options then 
 - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
 - Heap
 - QuickSelect

If asked for common strings then
 - Map
 - Trie

Else
 - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
 - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

 1. If you need to optimize for space
Consider bit manipulation techniques or greedy algorithms.

2. If the problem involves strings
Look for patterns like palindromes, anagrams or substrings and consider techniques like rolling hash.
